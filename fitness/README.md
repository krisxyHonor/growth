# Private Fitness Application

1. There are plenty of actions can be added to your fitness plan, you can set `group amount`, `break span` and `group duration` for each action, maybe more? like bgm or something similar.
2. You can config different fitness plans. For example, you can have a plan for abdominal training, a plan for chest training, a plan for back training.
3. You can start the training and make the time goes on all by the system, or you can pause at any time you want, or you can skip some actions at that time and move on to the next action.(maybe more flexible in the future)
